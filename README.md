This is a sample of some of the Data Science projects that I have worked on.

### Digit Removal from Street View House Numbers Images

This is a project I did for Machine Learning II in grad school. It uses the Street View House Numbers dataset, and builds a neural network in PyTorch that attempts to correctly classify the digits in the images. It then uses by-products from this network to build neural networks using Radial Basis Functions that attempt to regenerate the inital images with the digits removed. 

### Named Entity Recognition with Jeopardy! Clues

This is a project I did in my Natural Language Processing class in grad school. This project uses Keras with a TensorFlow backend to build and train a model to do named entity recognition in English sentences. It then tries out the model against Jeopardy! clues, obtained by scraping a fan web site using BeautifulSoup.

This is a Jupyter Notebook, which can be run in Google Colab.

### Breaking the Caesar Cipher with Machine Learning: An Introduction to Machine Learning for New Programmers

This Jupyter Notebook is something I did for a beginning programming class at a local Middle School. The audience is 7th-graders who are new to both programming and Python. This illustrates machine learning concepts such as training data and error functions through a program that breaks a Caesar Cipher after learning what English text look like.

It intentionally uses simple Python, avoiding list comprehensions, lambda functions, and even library includes. The goal is that a beginner can understand how it works and become introduced to the essence of Machine Learning.
