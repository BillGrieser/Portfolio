Each prediction uses the predicted next and predicted previous tag as part of the prediction. This function processes the words in both a forward and reverse direction until either both directions predict the same tags or the maximim number of tries is reached, in which case, the forward prediction is returned. In testing, some sentences agreed right away, others took 2 or 3 iterations to match, and the rest did not match after 10 tries, so the max iterations used is 4; if they haven't matched by then the liklihood of matching with more iterations is low."
